**Tagline:** *Empowering seamless healthcare access through one digital health identity.*

## What is MediLink?

MediLink is a secure digital health identity platform that provides user with a personalized medical profile that can be accessed wherever they seek care. MediLink connects hospitals, clinics, labs, pharmacies, and insurers, so patient verified medical history (allergies, chronic conditions, recent tests, current prescriptions) is available instantly especially during emergencies.

Imagine collapsing in a city away from home: a doctor scans your MediLink QR card and immediately sees the vital info needed to save your life. That’s MediLink.

## Why it matters

Healthcare today is fragmented as medical information is scattered across multiple hospitals, labs, and clinics. This often leads to repeated tests, delayed treatment, missed medical history and poor patient experiences

MediLink solves this by acting as a single source of truth for every individual’s health data, ensuring healthcare is Connected, Secure and Personalized. 

- **Saves lives** — doctors access critical info fast in emergencies.  
- **Reduces waste** — fewer repeated tests and faster diagnoses.  
- **Empowers patients** — you control who sees your data.  
- **Creates jobs** — local health record officers and onboarding agents.  
- **Supports policy** — anonymized data helps governments plan health programs.

## Who is this for?

- **Primary:** Patients (urban and rural), private clinics, diagnostic labs, pharmacies.

## How MediLink works (simple)

1. Patient registers and receives a MediLink Health ID.  
2. Clinics/Labs connect to MediLink via secure APIs and push verified records.  
3. Patient grants consent to providers to access or update records.  
4. In emergencies, authorized responders scan a QR and get a timed view of critical data.  
5. Payments and simple claims flow through the HealthPay Wallet.

## Tech snapshot (light, non-technical)

Built as a modular system so each part can be improved independently. Key technologies: React Native (mobile), Node.js (API), PostgreSQL (data), FHIR/HIPAA-friendly standards for health data exchange, and secure tokens for consent and authentication.
